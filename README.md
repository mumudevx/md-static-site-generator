## Usage

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: The project requires Rust for execution. Install it using [Rust Installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mumudevx/personal-website.git
cd personal-website
```

2. Build the project:

```sh
  cargo build
```

3. Prepare your content structure as follows:

```
src/
  content/
    blog/
      my-blog-post.md
    book/
      my-favorite-book.md
  assets/
    image.png
  template/
    base.html
    blog_list.html
    book_list.html
    homepage.html
```

4. Generate the static site:

```sh
cargo run
```

5. The output will be available in the dist/ directory.

## GitHub Actions Integration

The project includes CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions, enabling automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Steps

1. Configure GitHub Pages:

- Go to your GitHub repository.
- Navigate to Settings > Pages.
- Set the Source to the gh-pages branch.

2. Create a GitHub Actions workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Trigger the workflow when changes are pushed to the main branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch the full history to support deployments

      # Step 2: Setup Rust
      - name: Setup Rust
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable
          override: true

      # Step 3: Build the static site
      - name: Build Static Site
        run: |
          cargo build --release
          cargo run

      # Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_branch: gh-pages # Ensure we're deploying to the gh-pages branch
          publish_dir: ./dist # The directory containing the generated site
```

3. Push your changes to the main branch. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the site to GitHub Pages.

# Project Features

## Content and Templating

Place your Markdown files in the following structure:

```
src/
  content/
    blog/

  template/
    base.html
    homepage.html
    blog_list.html
    book_list.html
```

## Output

After running the command, the dist/ directory will contain the following output structure:

```
dist/
  index.html
  blog.html
  book.html
  blog/
    post1.html
  book/
    book1.html
  assets/
    image.png
```

# Notes

- You can include metadata at the beginning of your Markdown files, for example:

```markdown
---
title: Title Text
slug: post1
image: /assets/images/image.jpg
description: This is description context.
date: 08-12-2024
---
```

- The metadata is automatically extracted and used for generating listing pages.
